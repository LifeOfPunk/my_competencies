My inspiration is an idea of the new Internet. I’m absolutely excited about the potential of the XXI century and how our impact can grow humanity civilization in the nearest future.

Theoretically become a planet race humanity will need to structurate huge TB of data which will need to be obviously reliable. In another way we may collide with a lot of mistakes and misunderstandings. It’s absolutely crucial to obtain data, own, maintain and service it. No matter monetary transactions or pictures of bugs.

Of course it's a big responsibility for future generation and our task don't disappoint them.

**My main task** is explore new technologies, tell them to people as a conclusion make it real. In additional main problems a natural pollution, deforestation, resources balance are also very important and can be solved with great decantralised community that will have resources to make it.

**My desire and goals**
